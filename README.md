# get_on_discord_bot
This bot is still a work in progress

# What it does (will be doing when done)
When a user in chat types !(name) the bot will send a text message to whoever the name was
telling them to get on discord. This is meant to be just a fun thing between friends on a
small server

# What this bot is using
Build using the discord python library, requests python library, and uses the textbelt.com
API to send the text messages.
